          <text><h1>Overenrollment at Middlebury College.</h1></text>
          <div class="step">
            Before the pandemic (pre-spring 2020), in any given semester, there
            were typically about
            <b style="color: #785EF0">2,580 students</b> studying on campus at
            Middlebury College.</br></br>
            
            <b>1 stick-figure = 50 students</b>.
            
            </br></br>
            Please scroll down...
          </div>

          <div class="step">
            We also show the <b>735 first year students</b>, broken down by <b style="color: #FFB000">628 'regular' fall</b> and 
            <b style="color: #0840FF">107 'february'</b> students.
            </br></br>
            These numbers are pulled from 2018-2019's first-year population. The <el style="color: #FFB000">regular fall</el> 2018 class size 
            (excluding <el style="color: #0840FF">febs</el>) represents roughly 25% of the total student population on campus at that time.
          </div>

          <div class="step">
            Here's a box to hold all those people. That box is the <b style="color: #002f6c"> Middlebury College </b>campus. 
          </div>


          <div class="step">
            In non-pandemic circumstances, roughly <b style="color: #DC267F">300 students are typically abroad</b>. 
            These students are not counted in the enrollment, and, are obviously <b style="color: #DC267F">not on campus.</b> 
          </div>

          
          <div class="step">
            <p>
              Fast forward to Spring of 2021, a year after settling into the pandemic. </br></br>
              There are <b style="color: #785EF0">1,998 students studying on campus</b> and <b style="color: #FE6100">436 students studying remotely</b>.
            </p>
            <br>
          </div>

          <div class="step">
            <p>This spring of 2021:
              <ul>
              <li><b style="color: #DC267F">26 students are abroad</b> (compared to 300 on a normal year)</li>
              <li><b style="color: #5AB1BB">323 students are on leave of absence and will return in Fall 2021</b></li>
              <li><b style="color: #A5C882">75 students deferred from the class of 2024 to 2025</b></li>
            </ul>

            </p>
          </div>

          <div class="step">None of <b style="opacity: 0.3">these 860 students</b> are physically on campus.</div>

          <div class="step">The box represents the 2,580 students that Middlebury was used to accomodating in a pre-pandemic semester.</div>
          
          <div class="step">Fast forward to the <b>Fall of 2021</b>: here are the 2,858 students that are currently on campus. </div>

          <div class="step">
            This fall, there are <b style="color: #FFB000">682 first-year 'regular'</b> students, which includes the 
            <b style="color: #A5C882">75 first-year students who deferred enrollment by a year</b>.
            This represents only about 50 more first-years than during a typical year. 
            Additionally, this is still roughly 25% of the total student population currently on campus, which is what we might typically expect.
            </br></br>

            Moreover, Middlebury expects <b style="color: #0840FF">115 'feb' students</b> to arrive this February as part of the class of 2025.5.
            This number is also not exceedingly different from the feb class sizes of pre-pandemic years.

            </br></br>
            Lastly, you may recognize the <b style="color: #5AB1BB">323 who took a leave of abscence</b>.
            Also not seen here, are the <b style="color: #DC267F">99 students currently studying abroad</b> this fall term.
            This is far less than the pre-pandemic figure of roughly 300 study-abroad students.

            </br></br>
            This fall, the first-year class isn't that much bigger than usual; on the other hand, 
            fewer students than usual are abroad, and students who took time off in the spring of 2021 decided to return this fall.
            These are some of the major factors in explaining this fall's 'overenrollment' at Middlebury.
