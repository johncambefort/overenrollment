          <text><h1>Overenrollment at Middlebury College.</h1></text>
          <div class="step">
            Before the pandemic (pre-spring 2020), in any given semester, there
            were typically about
            <b style="color: #785EF0">2,580 students</b> studying on campus at
            Middlebury College.</br></br>
            
            <b>1 stick-figure = 50 students</b>.

          </div>

          <div class="step">
            We also show the <b>735 first year students</b>, broken down by <b style="color: #FFB000">628 'regular' fall</b> and 
            <b style="color: #0840FF">107 'february'</b> students.
            </br></br>
            These numbers are pulled from 2018-2019's first-year population. The <el style="color: #FFB000">regular fall</el> 2018 class size 
            (excluding <el style="color: #0840FF">febs</el>) represents roughly 25% of the total student population on campus at that time.

          <div class="step">
            Here's a box to hold all those people. That box is the <b style="color: #002f6c"> Middlebury College </b>campus. 
          </div>


          <div class="step">
            In non-pandemic circumstances, roughly <b style="color: #DC267F">300 students are typically abroad</b>. 
            These students are not counted in the enrollment, and, are obviously <b style="color: #DC267F">not on campus.</b> 
          </div>

          
          <div class="step">
            <p>
              Fast forward to Spring of 2021, a year after settling into the pandemic. </br></br>
              There are <b style="color: #785EF0">1,998 students studying on campus</b> and <b style="color: #FE6100">436 students studying remotely</b>.
            </p>
            <br>
          </div>

          <div class="step">
            <p>This spring of 2021:
              <ul>
              <li><b style="color: #DC267F">26 students are abroad</b> (compared to 300 on a normal year)</li>
              <li><b style="color: #5AB1BB">323 students are on leave of absence and will return in Fall 2021</b></li>
              <li><b style="color: #A5C882">75 students deferred from the class of 2024 to 2025</b></li>
            </ul>

          <div class="step">None of <b style="opacity: 0.3">these 860 students</b> are physically on campus.</div>

          <div class="step">The box represents the 2,580 students that Middlebury was used to accomodating in a pre-pandemic semester.</div>
          
          <div class="step">And here's the 2,858 students that are on campus this fall. </div>

          <div class="step">
            This fall, there are <b style="color: #FFB000">680 first-year 'regular'</b> students (excluding febs) -- this represents only about 50 more first-years than during a typical year. 
            Additionally, this is still roughly 25% of the total student population currently on campus, which is what we might typically expect.
