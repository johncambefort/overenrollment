          <h1>Overenrollment at Middlebury College.</h1>
        </text>


        <div class="step">
          In the pre-pandemic year 2018-2019, there were roughly <b style="color: #1F78B4">2,580 students on campus</b>
          at
          Middlebury College in a given semester.</br></br>
          Additionally, while these students are not counted toward Middlebury's enrollment count, roughly <b
            style="color: #B80C09">300 are studying abroad</b>.</br></br>

          <b>1 stick-figure = 50 students</b>.

          </br></br>
          Scroll down...
        </div>


        <div class="step">
          Here's a box to hold those 2580 people. The box reprents the <b style="color: #002f6c"> Middlebury College
            campus</b>
          max capacity in a pre-pandemic year.
        </div>


        <div class="step">
          <p>
            Fast forward to Spring of 2021, a year after settling into the pandemic. </br></br>
            There are <b style="color: #1F78B4">1,998 students studying on campus</b> and <b style="color: #33A02C">436
              students studying remotely</b>.
          </p>
          <br>
        </div>


        <div class="step">
          <p>Spring 2021 is a little different, however. In addition to the <b style="color: #33A02C">436 studying remotely</b>, we also have:
          <ul>
            <li><b style="color: #8BCF4F">323 students on a leave of absence</b> who will return in Fall 2021</li>
            <li><b style="color: #83BAD8">75 students who deferred</b> from the class of 2024 to 2025</li>
            <li><b style="color: #B80C09">26 students studying abroad</b> (compared to 300 on a 'typical' year)</li>
          </ul>
          <i>Note</i>: 606 students are about to graduate. These students will be replaced by 607 new first-years not shown here (this
          number does not include the 75 students who deferred a year; including these brings the class of 2025 total to 682).
          </p>
        </div>


        <div class="step">Fast forward to the <b>Fall of 2021</b>: here are the <b>2,858 students on campus</b>. Everyone who
          was away in the spring has now returned.

          </br></br>
          A common misconception about overenrollment is that the Admissions office admitted a larger-than-normal first-year class. <b>This is false</b>.
          
          </br></br>
          This fall, there are 682 first-year 'regular' students, which includes the <b style="color: #83BAD8">75 first-year students who deferred
            enrollment by a year</b>.

          </br></br>
          This represents only about 50 more first-years than during a typical year. For instance, in fall 2018, there were 628 new first-years.
          Additionally, this fall's class size is still roughly 25% of the total student population currently on campus, which is what we
          might typically expect.
        </div>


        <div class="step">
          <b>The box representing campus capacity is clearly overflowing</b>. So what's causing 'over-enrollment' as we perceive it?

          </br></br>
          The first-year class isn't actually that much bigger than usual. On the other hand,
          there are only <b style="color: #B80C09">99 students abroad</b> (compared to the typical 300), 
          the <b style="color: #8BCF4F">323 students who took time off last semester</b> due to the pandemic decided to return this fall, and <b style="color: #83BAD8">75
          first-years deferred admission by a year</b>.

          </br></br>
          These are some of the major factors in explaining this fall's 'overenrollment' at Middlebury.
