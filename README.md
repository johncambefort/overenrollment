# Breaking down Overenrollment in Fall 2021 at Middlebury College

This project holds the data and code for a data visualization that breaks down the student population and enrollment before and during the Covid-19 pandemic, up until the Fall 2021. In particular, the visualization debunks a rumor that the Admissions Office enrolled far more first-year students than usual, leading to a scenario of [overenrollment](https://www.middleburycampus.com/article/2021/09/dining-halls-and-parking-lots-stretched-thin-due-to-over-enrollment). While it is true that the main campus was overenrolled in the fall of 2021, the first-year class size was roughly the same as that of recent & pre-pandemic years. Check out the visualization for the full picture!

This "[scrolly-telling](https://bost.ocks.org/mike/scroll/)" visualization leverages Javascript's [D3](https://d3js.org/) library to animate the stick-figures and bind the data to the shapes.

An initial version of this visualization was completed with Sabrina Templeton '22 as an assignment for Professor Christopher Andrews' "Information Visualizations" course. After this point, I further developed & refactored the visualization, and made it ready for publishing in the [Middlebury Campus](https://middleburycampus.com) newspaper. This was my first real proper D3 visualization and, while it's not perfect, it served as an introduction to the highly-versatile tool that is D3!
